Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?
-The runtime is O(n)

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?
- The space complexity is O(n) because you have to allocate memory for capacity (n) items
3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
-Runtime complexity is O(n) because i have to iterate through each element as long as it is not None
4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
The space complexity is O(n) since we iterate trhough the array and save the value in index variable.


5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
-The runtime for the provided code is O(n^2) because of the nested for loop

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
-The space complexity is O(n^2) because you allocate memory for each loop.
7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
-the runtime complexity is O(n)

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
-The space complexity is O(n) because you allocate memory for each item in the list
